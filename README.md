# Stephane Leandre Paul

I have always been absolutely fascinated with computers and technology. Iâ€™m fortunate to say now that what began as a self-taught hobby at a young age became a passion and career.

I am continuously learning, fascinated by how I can achieve a faster, cleaner and more productive result as a developer.
